    "What makes InfluxDB time series database unique?\n",
    "\n",
    "InfluxDB was built from the ground up to be a purpose-built time series database; i.e., it was not repurposed to be time series. Time was built-in from the beginning. InfluxDB is part of a comprehensive platform that supports the collection, storage, monitoring, visualization and alerting of time series data. It‚Äôs much more than just a time series database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole InfluxData platform is built from an open source db core. InfluxData is an active contributor to the Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf  and Kapacitor (TICK) projects ‚Äî the ‚ÄúI,C,K‚Äù from the TICK Stack is being collapsed into a single binary in InfluxDB 2.0 ‚Äî as well as selling InfluxDB Enterprise and InfluxDB Cloud on this open source core. The InfluxDB data model is quite different from other time series solutions like Graphite, RRD, or OpenTSDB. InfluxDB has a line protocol for sending time series data which takes the following form: measurement-name tag-set field-set timestamp. The measurement name is a string, the tag set is a collection of key/value pairs where all values are strings, and the field set is a collection of key/value pairs where the values can be int64, float64, bool, or string. The measurement name and tag sets are kept in an inverted index which make lookups for specific series very fast. For example, if we have CPU metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "cpu,host=serverA,region=uswest idle=23,user=42,system=12 1464623548s\n",
    "\n",
    "Timestamps in InfluxDB can be second, millisecond, microsecond, or nanosecond precision. The micro and nanosecond scales make InfluxDB a good choice for use cases in finance and scientific computing where other solutions would be excluded. Compression is variable depending on the level of precision the user needs. On disk, the data is organized in a columnar style format where contiguous blocks of time are set for the measurement, tagset, field. So, each field is organized sequentially on disk for blocks of time, which make calculating aggregates on a single field a very fast operation. There is no limit to the number of tags and fields that can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other time series solutions don‚Äôt support multiple fields, which can make their network protocols bloated when transmitting data with shared tag sets. Most other time series solutions only support float64 values, which means the user is unable to encode additional metadata along with the time series. Even OpenTSDB and KairosDB, which support tags (unlike Graphite and RRD), have limitations on the number of tags that can be used. At around 5 to 6 tags, the user will start seeing hot spots within their cluster of HBase or Cassandra machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "InfluxDB doesn‚Äôt have this limitation because the InfluxDB data model is designed for time series specifically. It pushes the developer in the right direction to get good performance out of the database by indexing tags and keeping fields unindexed. It‚Äôs flexible in that many data types are supported, and the user can have many fields and tags. Because of all these factors, a purpose-built time series database like InfluxDB is the best solution for working with time series data."

    "How to avoid disk space saturation\n",
    "\n",
    "InfluxDB is a time series database. Such database typically receive a lot of metrics and doesn't delete them. This means that your database will grow infinitely.\n",
    "Unfortunately, you don't have infinite disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid a disk space saturation, InfluxDB provides two solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one consists in deleting the data prior to a defined date. For example, you will define that data older than 365 days have to be deleted.\n",
    "This is called \"retention\" and you will find more information about it below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second one is to downsample your data. Imagine you store a temperature every second. It is great to have a live view of the temperature, but you probably don't need to keep a 1-second resolution for months.\n",
    "You can, for example, downsample this metric like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    keep temperature with 1 second resolution for the last 5 minutes.\n",
    "    keep maximums, minimums and averages temperatures with 1 minute resolution for the last 24 hours.\n",
    "    keep maximums, minimums and averages temperatures with 1 hour resolution for the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using retention, you will be able to keep your data for a long period without having to store terabytes of data.\n",
    "You will find more information about downsample on the official documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling InfluxDB retention\n",
    "\n",
    "Per default, InfluxDB will store your data and never delete them.\n",
    "While this seems normal for a classical database, it is not for a time series database type.\n",
    "Indeed, a time series database is supposed to delete its oldest data to avoid unlimited growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you store a battery voltage, the data is probably interesting for few days but not for years.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid any disk space saturation, this is very important that you configure a retention period for each of your buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, go to your InfluxDB WEB UI, click on \"Data\", then \"Buckets\" and click on \"Settings\" closed to the bucket you want to configure.\n",
    "Then select \"Delete data older than\" and select the retention you desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget that you will loose data older than this retention period!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that data are organized in shards. Shards with outdated data will be deleted.\n",
    "But a shard which contains outdated and non outdated data will not be deleted.\n",
    "By default, when no retention has been defined, a shard contains 7 days of data. That means that when you will define a retention period, almost 7 days of outdated data will be kept, in addition to your fresh data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find more information about shards on the official documentation."

    "Why use InfluxDB?\n",
    "Faster time\n",
    "Deep insights and analytics\n",
    "Efficient in developer productivity- InfluxDB is ‚Äî storage,ingest, query, and visualization ‚Äî which is now accessible via unified API.\n",
    "UI dashboards to view the data like Grafana,Chronograf\n",
    "Easy-to-build, easy-to-share templates- through influxDb templates\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When to use InfluxDB\n",
    "\n",
    "InfluxDB is perfect if you want to store, query and analyze metrics data, like IoT sensors, monitoring records or applications metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, IoT devices that are connected using WiFi, 5G, Sigfox or LoRa networks send their sensors values (temperatures, 3 axis accelerometer, GPS coordinates, etc...) at regular intervals. These data are enhanced with health data like battery voltage and network reception.\n",
    "There IoT devices will send all these data at regular intervals to InfluxDB that will store them in an efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "With its high performances API, InfluxDB can ingest thousands of data per seconds with no problem.\n",
    "And with its advanced \"Flux\" language, you will be able to query and analyze these data in few lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes InfluxDB so great\n",
    "\n",
    "InfluxDB is an awesome product for these reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "    It perfectly handles telemetry data like monitoring, applications metrics or IoT sensors\n",
    "    Data are automatically compressed to manage disk occupation efficiently\n",
    "    Downsampling tasks run automatically to reduce disk usage and increase query performances\n",
    "    Retention policies can be applied to automatically delete old data after a defined amount of time\n",
    "    Flux language is super porwerful and permits to analyze in depth stored data\n",
    "    InfluxDB WEB UI gives the ability to create beautiful dasbboards in minutes\n"
